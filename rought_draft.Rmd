##Abstract
##Introduction
As the year comes to a close, Washington D.C. is marking the end of the 115th Congress (2017-2018) and the halfway point of President Donald Trump's first term. There seems to be perception by the public that Congress is more partisan than ever, but is this really true? Inspired by Fowler's work on Congressional Cosponsorship Data, we set out to figure out how divided Congress really is. In order to have a smaller sample size, we use the cosponsorship data of (n bills) in the Senate during the 1115h Congress. How much cosponsorship goes on between each party and who seems to be facilitating this? Do Senatorial Caucuses help explain who tends to sponsor with whomst? These are the questions that we set out to answer. 

##Data
We obtained our data through multiple sources. All data relating to cosponsorship were obtained from [INSERT WEBSITE HERE]. We collected attributes including age, party, state represented, and the number of bills sponsered and cosponsered for each senator from Wikipedia and Congress.gov.
